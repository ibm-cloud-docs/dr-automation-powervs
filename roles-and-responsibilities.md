# Roles and responsibilities

Managed products on customer resources are IBM-managed, single-tenant solutions hosted within the customer’s account. IBM manages the underlying infrastructure, while customers handle their data and applications. This setup ensures secure, shared responsibility: IBM controls foundational infrastructure, and customers maintain their data and application security. Examples include IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud.
