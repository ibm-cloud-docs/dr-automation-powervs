# Managing events logs

The **Events** in the {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}} interface provides an overview of the key activities and status changes within your virtual server instances. This log of events enables administrators to track and review significant actions, such as server stops, starts, and any alerts or warnings that may require attention. Monitoring these events ensures that the disaster recovery environment functions optimally and that any potential issues can be promptly addressed.

## Accessing the event logs

You can access a maximum of 400 events for the current and previous months in the IBM Cloud console. To see the event logs, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the IBM Cloud catalog with your credentials.
2. In the catalog's search box, type IBM速 Power速 Virtual Server, and click the Workspace for IBM速 Power速 Virtual Server tile.
3. Click Select workspace on the left navigation under workspace of the {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}} user  interface to select from a list of previously created workspaces. If you do not have a workspace, click Create a workspace.
4. Click Event logs to see the list of event logs and notifications.

In this section, administrators can view detailed records of the virtual server activities, including:

- **Type**: The kind of event that occurred, such as actions on virtual server instances.

- **Details**: A description of the event, for example, whether the virtual server was stopped or any other relevant action was taken.

- **Date**: The exact time and date the event was logged, helping track the sequence of activities.

- **Severity**: The importance level of the event, which could range from informative (Info) to critical warnings (Caution).
