# Verify events

The **Events** section in the DR Automation for Power Virtual Server interface provides an overview of the key activities and status changes within your virtual server instances. This log of events enables administrators to track and review significant actions, such as server stops, starts, and any alerts or warnings that may require attention. Monitoring these events ensures that the disaster recovery environment functions optimally and that any potential issues can be promptly addressed.

In this section, administrators can view detailed records of the virtual server activities, including:

- **Type**: The kind of event that occurred, such as actions on virtual server instances.
- **Details**: A description of the event, for example, whether the virtual server was stopped or any other relevant action was taken.
- **Date**: The exact time and date the event was logged, helping track the sequence of activities.
- **Severity**: The importance level of the event, which could range from informative (Info) to critical warnings (Caution).

By monitoring the events listed in this section, users can maintain a clear overview of the operational status of their virtual servers and respond to any warnings or issues as needed.
