# Creating network pairing (Optional)

Network pairing establishes communication links between network devices or systems to ensure seamless data transmission and operational connectivity. This is an **optional setup** and is typically performed after managing virtual machines (VMs) and organizing them into WorkGroups. After completing the VM management process, the GUI navigates you to the **Network Pairing** page.

All VMs added to the WorkGroup are automatically populated on the **Network Pairing** page.

To complete the network pairing, follow these steps:

1. Select the VM that requires network pairing from the list.
2. Select the source network from the **Source Network** drop-down menu and the corresponding target network from the **Target Network** drop-down menu.
3. If you need to create a new target network, click **Create New Target Network** and configure the required settings.
4. Click **Save & Next** to finalize the network pairing.
5. To review the paired networks, click **Show Network Pairs**.
6. To clear the pairing, click **Clear Selection** and confirm to unpair the network configuration.

> **Note**: When confirming network pairings for one VM within a shared workspace and network setup, the confirmation is automatically applied to other VMs with similar configurations.
