# Managing events logs
{: #manage-log}

The **Events** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}} interface provides an overview of the key activities and status changes within your virtual server instances. This log of events enables administrators to track and review significant actions, such as server stops, starts, and any alerts or warnings that might require attention. Monitoring these events ensures that the disaster recovery environment functions optimally and that any potential issues can be promptly addressed.
