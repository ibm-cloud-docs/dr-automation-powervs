# Activity tracker events

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker Event Routing service to track how users and applications interact with the IBM® DR® Autoamtion for PowerVS in IBM Cloud®.

Activity Tracker Event Routing records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [Getting started tutorial for Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

IBM® DR® Autoamtion Server automatically generates events so that you can track activity on your service.
