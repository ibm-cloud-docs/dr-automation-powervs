# Creating the KSYS cluster

Configure your **IBM_PVS_DR** environment by adding the KSYS (Orchestrator) Cluster, specifying host details, and selecting the appropriate deployment type. If the KSYS Cluster is not already added to your **IBM_PVS_DR** environment, you will be redirected to the **Add** KSYS Subsystem page upon logging into the GUI.
