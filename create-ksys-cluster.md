# Creating the KSYS cluster
{: #create-orch-ksys}

Select your **IBM_PVS_DR** environment by adding the KSYS (Orchestrator) Cluster, specifying host details, and choosing the appropriate deployment type. If the KSYS Cluster is not already added to your environment, the system redirects you to the **Add KSYS Subsystem** page after you log in to the GUI.

1. Navigate to the **Add KSYS Subsystem** page if it does not open automatically after login.
2. Click the **Add KSYS** button.
3. Enter the host details along with the **Username** and **Password** for the KSYS (Orchestrator) system.
4. Select the deployment type from the **KSYS Deployment Type** drop-down menu, choose **IBM_PVS_DR** for a standard disaster recovery setup. 
5. Enter the **KSYS Cluster Details** as required.
6. (Optional) Enable the **Add Proxy** checkbox if your KSYS system communicates through a proxy.
7. Click **Save & Next** to save your configuration and continue to the next setup step.

This process enables the integration of the KSYS (Orchestrator) Cluster into your disaster recovery setup.
