# Creating the KSYS (Orchestrator) cluster

Configure your **IBM_PVS_DR** environment by adding the KSYS (Orchestrator) Cluster, specifying host details, and selecting the appropriate deployment type. If the KSYS Cluster is not already added to your **IBM_PVS_DR** environment, you will be redirected to the **Add KSYS Subsystem** page upon logging into the GUI.

## Steps to Add the KSYS Cluster

1. **Access the Add KSYS Subsystem Page**:  
   After logging into the GUI, navigate to the **Add KSYS Subsystem** page if it does not open automatically.

2. **Click Add KSYS**:  
   Click the **Add KSYS** button.

3. **Provide Host Details**:  
   Enter the host details, including the username for the KSYS (Orchestrator).

4. **Select Deployment Type**:  
   From the **KSYS Deployment Type** drop-down menu, select **IBM_PVS_DR** as the deployment type.

5. **Enter KSYS Cluster Details**:  
   - Fill in the required KSYS details.  
   - Specify the KSYS cluster details.

6. **Save and Proceed**:  
   Click **Save & Next** to save your configuration and proceed.

This process enables the integration of the KSYS (Orchestrator) Cluster into your disaster recovery setup.
