# ksysmgr command(Orchestrator)

The command provides a consistent interface to configure the controller system (KSYS) and to perform IBMÂ® VM Recovery Manager DR operations by using a terminal or script.

## syntax

    ksysmgr [-v] [-f] [-l {low|max}] [-i] 
    [-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}] <ACTION> <CLASS> [<NAME>]
    [-h | <ATTR#1>=<VALUE#1> <ATTR#2>=<VALUE#2> ...]

    ksysmgr [-v] [-f] [-l {low|max}] 
    [-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}] <ACTION> <CLASS> [<NAME>]
    <ATTR#1>=<VALUE#1> <ATTR#2>=<VALUE#2> ...]

         ACTION={add|modify|delete|query|manage|unmanage|...}\n\
         CLASS={ksyscluster|site|...}\n\

    ksysmgr {-h|-?} [-v] [<ACTION> [<CLASS>]]

    ksysmgr [-v] help


The basic format for using the ksysmgr command is as follows:

    ksysmgr ACTION CLASS [NAME] [ATTRIBUTES...]
>**Note:**
> - You must have root authority to run the ksysmgr command.
> - Help information is available for the ksysmgr command from the command line. For example, when you run the ksysmgr command without any flags or parameters a list of the available ACTIONs is displayed.
> - If you enter ksysmgr <ACTION> in the command line without specifying any CLASS, the command results in a list of all the available CLASSes for the specified ACTION.
> - Entering ksysmgr <ACTION> <CLASS> without specifying any NAME or ATTRIBUTES parameters is different because some ACTION and CLASS combinations do not require any additional parameters. To display help information in this scenario, you can view the help information by appending the -h flag to the ksysmgr <ACTION> <CLASS> command.
> - You cannot display help information from the command line for each of the ksysmgr command's ATTRIBUTES.

## Description

All ksysmgr command operations are logged in the ```/var/ksys/log/ksysmgr.oplog``` file, including the name of the executed command, start time, process ID for the ksysmgr operation, the command with arguments, and overall return code.

## ACTION

The ```ACTION``` flags are not case-sensitive. All ```ACTION``` flags provide a shorter alias. For example, ```rm``` is an alias for ```delete```. Aliases are provided for convenience from the command line and must not be used in scripts.

The following ```ACTION``` flags are available:

>Note: The asterisk ```(*)``` in the aliases signify wildcard characters. For example, for the modify ACTION, the alias value is ```modd```. If you type ```mod*```, the command still works.

```query (alias: q*, ls, get, sh*)```

```add (alias: ad*, create, cr*, make, mk, bu*, bld)```

```delete (alias: de*, remov*, rm, er*)```

```modify (alias: mod*, ch*, set, sets)```

```restore (alias: rest*)```

```manage (alias: man*, mg)```

```unmanage (alias: unman*, umg)```

```discover (alias: di*)```

```move (alias: mov*, mv, swi*)```

```pair (alias: map)```

```refresh```

## CLASS

Specifies the type of object on which the ```ACTION``` is performed. The ```CLASS``` flags are not case-sensitive.

The following ```CLASS``` objects are supported:

```ksyscluster (alias: cl*, ksyscl*)```

- ```site (alias: sit*)```

```vm (alias: lp*, vm*)```

```notify (alias: rn, remote_not*, noti*)```

```snapshot (alias: snap*)```

```script```

```workgroup```

```disk```

```event```

```system (alias: sys*)```

```workspace```

```network```

```region```

## NAME

Specifies the particular object, of type **CLASS** , on which the **ACTION** must be performed. The NAME flags are case-sensitive.

**ATTR=VALUE**

Specifies an optional flag that has attribute pairs and value pairs that are specific to the **ACTION** and **CLASS** combination. Use these pairs to specify configuration settings or to run particular operations. Both **ATTR** and **VALUE** flags are case-sensitive.

**```-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}```**

Displays only the specified attributes. This flag must be used with the query ACTION flag. For example:

```ksysmgr -a name,sitetype query site```

`-f`

Overrides any interactive prompts and forces the current operation to be run.

`-h`

Displays help information.

`-i`

Indicates that the ksysmgr command must prompt for your confirmation for important operations such as move operation across sites.

`-l low|max`

Activates the following trace logging values for troubleshooting purposes:

`low (default)`

Logs basic information for every ksysmgr operation.

`max`

Performs high tracing operations such as adding the routine function and the utility function. Adds transaction ID to the function's entry messages.

> Note: All trace data is written into the ksysmgr.log file. This flag is ideal for troubleshooting problems.

`-v`

Displays maximum verbosity in the output.

### Exit status

**RC_UNKNOWN (Exit value = -1)**

Result is not known. This value is used as an initializer.

**RC_SUCCESS (Exit value = 0)**

No errors are detected. The operation is successful.

**RC_ERROR (Exit value = 1)**

An error occurred.

**RC_NOT_FOUND (Exit value = 2)**

The specified resource does not exist or cannot be found.

**RC_MISSING_INPUT (Exit value = 3)**

Required input is missing.

**RC_INCORRECT_INPUT (Exit value = 4)**

Detected input is incorrect.

## Examples

To get help information about the ksyscluster class, enter the following command:

```ksysmgr help ksyscluster```

An output that is similar to the following example is displayed:

```Available actions for ksyscluster: add delete modify query sync verify```

### Cluster configuration examples

#### To add a KSYS cluster:

```
ksysmgr add ksyscluster
[<ksysclustername>]
[type=<HA|DR|HADR|HADRHA|IBM_PVS_DR>]
ksysnodes=<ksysnode1[,ksysnode2,...]>
[sync=<yes|no>]
apikey=<apikey>
[baseurl=<baseurl>]
[proxy=<ipaddress:portnumber>]
add => ad*, cr*, make, mk
ksyscluster => ksysclu*, clu*

 **Note**: apikey, baseurl and proxy are applicable only for `IBM_PVS_DR cluster` 
```

An output that is similar to the following example is displayed:
```
Adding node to current cluster configuration
Ksyscluster has been created, running verify now
Ksyscluster has been verified, running sync now
Stopping KSYS subsystem ...
Starting KSYS subsystem ...
KSYS subsystem has started. You can begin adding site definitions, etc

**Note**: By default, the value of type variable is DR cluster type. 
```

#### To query the KSYS cluster:

```
ksysmgr query ksyscluster <ksysclustername>
query => q*, ls, get, sh*
ksyscluster => ksysclu*, clu*
```

An output that is similar to the following example is displayed:
```
Name: pvs_dr
State: Online
Type: IBM_PVS_DR
Ksysnodes: ksys804p.aus.stglabs.ibm.com:1:Online
KsysState: ksys804p.aus.stglabs.ibm.com:1:Online
```

#### To remove a KSYS cluster:

```
ksysmgr [-f] delete ksyscluster <ksysclustername>
delete => de*, remove, rm, erase
ksyscluster => ksysclu*, clu*
```

When you delete a KSYS cluster, the **ksysmgr** command prompts for your confirmation. The **ksysmgr** command also recommends to create a snapshot at this point. 

An output that is similar to the following example is displayed:
```
**WARNING**: This action will remove all configuration and destroy the KSYS setup. It's recommended to create a backup with "ksysmgr add snapshot -h"
```

Do you want a backup to be created now ? [y|n]

`y`
```
Taking snapshot...
Created: /var/ksys/snapshots/oldclust_DETAILED_2024-07-29_06:35:30.xml.tar.gz
Successfully created a configuration snapshot: /var/ksys/snapshots/oldclust_DETAILED_2024-07-29_06:35:30.xml.tar.gz
```

Do you wish to store the logs on successful cluster deletion? [y|n]

`y`

Do you wish to proceed? [y|n]

`y`

This may take a few minutes to remove the ksyscluster

VM Maheshwari was successfully unmanaged

The ksysmgr unmanage ALL host=<hostname> command will unmanage all virtual machines in the host <hostname>. The ksysmgr unmanage ALL host_group=HG1 command will unmanage all virtual machines in the host group HG1.

ksysmgr unmanage vm <vmname|lparuuid,....> unmanage => unman*, umg vm => lp*, vm

The preceding command syntax can be used for targeted VM management. The excluded virtual machine is not moved to the backup site when a site-switch operation is initiated.

Notes: Including or excluding a virtual machine, you must run the discovery and verification commands to rediscover the resources and validate the modified configuration setting.

To update the priority of virtual machines:

ksysmgr modify vm <vmname>

[targetsystem=<target_system_type>]

modify => mod*, ch*, set

vm => lp*, vm

Note: The display_all option can be used before performing the first discovery operation to display only minimum information about the VMs that are added to the KSYS configuration. To display the current information about a VM, use the ksysmgr query vm command without the display_all option.

Discovery and verification examples

To discover the resources in a site:

ksysmgr discover site <sitename>

discover => di*

site => sit*
