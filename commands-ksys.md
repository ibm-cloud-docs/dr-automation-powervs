# ksysmgr command(Orchestrator)

{: #comm}

The command provides a consistent interface to configure the controller system (KSYS) and to perform {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}} operations by using a terminal or script.
{:shortdesc: .shortdesc}

## syntax
{: #syn}

    ksysmgr [-v] [-f] [-l {low|max}] [-i] 
    [-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}] <ACTION> <CLASS> [<NAME>]
    [-h | <ATTR#1>=<VALUE#1> <ATTR#2>=<VALUE#2> ...]

    ksysmgr [-v] [-f] [-l {low|max}] 
    [-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}] <ACTION> <CLASS> [<NAME>]
    <ATTR#1>=<VALUE#1> <ATTR#2>=<VALUE#2> ...]

         ACTION={add|modify|delete|query|manage|unmanage|...}\n\
         CLASS={ksyscluster|site|...}\n\

    ksysmgr {-h|-?} [-v] [<ACTION> [<CLASS>]]

    ksysmgr [-v] help

The basic format for using the ksysmgr command is as follows:

    ksysmgr ACTION CLASS [NAME] [ATTRIBUTES...]
>**Note:**
> - You must have root authority to run the ksysmgr command.
> - Help information is available for the ksysmgr command from the command line. For example, when you run the ksysmgr command without any flags or parameters a list of the available ACTIONs is displayed.
> - If you enter ksysmgr <ACTION> in the command line without specifying any CLASS, the command results in a list of all the available CLASSes for the specified ACTION.
> - Entering ksysmgr <ACTION> <CLASS> without specifying any NAME or ATTRIBUTES parameters is different because some ACTION and CLASS combinations do not require any additional parameters. To display help information in this scenario, you can view the help information by appending the -h flag to the ksysmgr <ACTION> <CLASS> command.
> - You cannot display help information from the command line for each of the ksysmgr command's ATTRIBUTES.

## Description
{: #des}
All ksysmgr command operations are logged in the ```/var/ksys/log/ksysmgr.oplog``` file, including the name of the executed command, start time, process ID for the ksysmgr operation, the command with arguments, and overall return code.

## ACTION
{: #ac}

The ```ACTION``` flags are not case-sensitive. All ```ACTION``` flags provide a shorter alias. For example, ```rm``` is an alias for ```delete```. Aliases are provided for convenience from the command line and must not be used in scripts.

The following ```ACTION``` flags are available:

>Note: The asterisk ```(*)``` in the aliases signify wildcard characters. For example, for the modify ACTION, the alias value is ```modd```. If you type ```mod*```, the command still works.

```query (alias: q*, ls, get, sh*)```

```add (alias: ad*, cr*, make, mk)```

```delete (alias: de*, remov*, rm, er*)```

```modify (alias: mod*, ch*, set)```

```restore (alias: rest*)```

```manage (alias: man*, mg)```

```unmanage (alias: unman*, umg)```

```discover (alias: di*)```

```move (alias: mov*, mv, swi*)```

```pair (alias: map)```

```refresh (ref*)```

```resync (resy*)```

```update```

## CLASS
{: #cla}

Specifies the type of object on which the ```ACTION``` is performed. The ```CLASS``` flags are not case-sensitive.

The following ```CLASS``` objects are supported:

```ksyscluster (alias: cl*, ksyscl*)```

 ```site (alias: sit*)```

```vm (alias: lp*, vm*)```

```notify (alias: rn, remote_not*, noti*)```

```snapshot (alias: snap*)```

```script (scr*)```

```workgroup (workg*, work_g*, wg)```

```disk```

```disk_group (dg, disk_g*)```

```event (ev*)```

```system (alias: sys*)```

```workspace (works*, work_s*, ws)```

```network (netw*, nw, net_work, net_w*)```

```region (regio*)```

## NAME
{: #nam}

Specifies the particular object, of type **CLASS** , on which the **ACTION** must be performed. The NAME flags are case-sensitive.

**ATTR=VALUE**

Specifies an optional flag that has attribute pairs and value pairs that are specific to the **ACTION** and **CLASS** combination. Use these pairs to specify configuration settings or to run particular operations. Both **ATTR** and **VALUE** flags are case-sensitive.

```-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}```

Displays only the specified attributes. This flag must be used with the query ACTION flag. For example:

```ksysmgr -a name, query site```

`-f`

Overrides any interactive prompts and forces the current operation to be run.

`-h`

Displays help information.

`-i`

Indicates that the ksysmgr command must prompt for your confirmation for important operations such as move operation across sites.

`-l low|max`

Activates the following trace logging values for troubleshooting purposes:

`low (default)`

Logs basic information for every ksysmgr operation.

`max`

Performs high tracing operations such as adding the routine function and the utility function. Adds transaction ID to the function's entry messages.

> Note: All trace data is written into the ksysmgr.log file. This flag is ideal for troubleshooting problems.

`-v`

Displays maximum verbosity in the output.

### Exit status
{: #exit}

**RC_UNKNOWN (Exit value = -1)**

Result is not known. This value is used as an initializer.

**RC_SUCCESS (Exit value = 0)**

No errors are detected. The operation is successful.

**RC_ERROR (Exit value = 1)**

An error occurred.

**RC_NOT_FOUND (Exit value = 2)**

The specified resource does not exist or cannot be found.

**RC_MISSING_INPUT (Exit value = 3)**

Required input is missing.

**RC_INCORRECT_INPUT (Exit value = 4)**

Detected input is incorrect.

## Examples

## Target system type
{: #Tr-sy-ty}

You can optionally specify a target system type when configuring a backup VM. This attribute allows the backup VM to run on a system different from the source.  For example,  If the production VM runs on a Power10 server and the backup VM can run on  Power9 server.

> **Note**: Setting the target system type is currently not supported for PowerVS Private Plan.

To configure a backup VM to run on a specific target system type, run the following command, run the following command:

```ksysmgr manage vm test-syd targetsystemtype=s922```

The following example output is displayed:

```
# ksysmgr manage vm test-1 targetsystemtype=s922
Refresh VMs list of Test-lon04 workspace started
Refresh VMs list of Test-lon04 workspace completed
Refresh Networks list of Test-lon04 workspace started
Refresh Networks list of Test-lon04 workspace completed
```

To modify a backup VM to run on a specific target system type, run the following command:

```ksysmgr modify vm test-syd targetsystemtype=e980```

The following example output is displayed:

```
ksysmgr modify vm test_syd04 targetsystemtype=e980
TargetSystemType e980 was found and modified successfully
```

>**Note**: Modifying target system type is allowed only before first discovery.

## Shared Processor Pool configuration
{: #s-pro-poo-confi}

### Enable shared processor pool for a virtual machine for Public and Private Plan
{: #es-pp-vm}

To reduce licensing costs and optimize resource usage, you can enable the shared processor pool for a virtual machine. Before assigning, you must create the shared processor pool in the target PowerVS workspace.

Run the following command on Orchestrator node to manage the VM, and assign it to a shared processor pool:

```ksysmgr manage vm <vmname> sharedprocpool=yes targetprocpool=<pool_name>```

The following example output is displayed:

```
date; ksysmgr manage vm test_vm sharedprocpool=yes targetprocpool=test_pool
Wed May 28 14:22:35 IST 2025 Refresh VMs list of test_workspace started
Workgroup test_vm_WG added successfully
For Vm test_vm attribute(s) ShareProcPoolEnable was successfully modified.
For Vm test_vm attribute(s) TargetProcPool was successfully modified.
```

> **Note**: Both `sharedprocpool=yes` and `targetprocpool=<pool_name>` are mandatory parameters.

### Modify shared processor pool settings for a virtual machine Public and Private Plan
{: #msp-pp-vm}

To apply shared processor pool settings after a VM has already been managed, use the following command:

```ksysmgr modify vm <vmname> sharedprocpool=yes targetprocpool=<pool_name>```

The following example output is displayed:

```
ksysmgr modify vm test_vm sharedprocpool=yes targetprocpool=test_pool
For Vm test_vm attribute(s) ShareProcPoolEnable was successfully modified.
For Vm test_vm attribute(s) TargetProcPool was successfully modified.
```

**Note**: Modifying shared processor pool is allowed only before first discovery.

### Verify shared processor pool assignment for Public and Private Plan
{: #vs-pp-a}

To confirm that the VM is assigned to a shared processor pool, run the following command:

```ksysmgr query vm <vmname>```

The following example output is displayed:

```
UUID:             12345678-1234-5678-9xxx-0123456789xx
Processors:       1
Memory_capacity:  4
SharedProcPool:   yes
TargetProcPool:   test_pool
```

### View backup VM configuration in PowerVS
{: #vb-vm-cpv}

To check the shared processor pool assignment and current resource configuration of the backup VM, run:

```ibmcloud pi ins get <backup_vm_name>```

The following example output is displayed:

```
CPU Cores:               0.25
Memory:                  2
Processor Type:          shared
Shared Processor Pool:   test_pool
Shared Processor Pool ID: abcd1234-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz-abcdef123456
Status:                  SHUTOFF
```
This confirms the VM was provisioned with reduced capacity and associated with the specified processor pool.

### Resource reduction during site switchovers Public and Private Plan
{: #rr-pp-vm}

When a source VM is configured with a shared processor pool and its backup VM is also assigned to a shared processor pool, the system automatically adjusts resources during a site move:

- **During discovery or DR readiness**:If the shared processor pool is configured for the target site, the backup VM is created with minimum CPU and memory resources from that pool.
This helps minimize cost while maintaining DR readiness.

- **Move from home site to backup site**: If Shared processor pool is configured for target site and source vm is from shared processor pool, during DR Readiness, target backup vm will be initially created with minimum resources.During move from home site to backup site, source vm which will be shutdown will be reduced to minimum resource and target system will be increase to actually vm resource configuration.

> **Note**: If source vm is not from shared processor pool but target site shared processor pool is configured. During move the source vm capacity will not be reduced during shutdown. Where target system resource will be increase utilizing resource from given pool.

- **Move back from backup site to home site**: The VM’s resources are restored to the original configuration values. This automated resource optimization helps reduce licensing costs and ensures efficient utilization during disaster recovery operations.

- **DR Rehearsal**: If the shared processor pool is configured for the target site, the rehearsal VM is created using resources from the target shared processor pool.
The rehearsal VM also respects the target system type defined by the user.

### List shared processor pools for Public and Private Plan
{: #li-sh-pro-po}

To list all shared processor pools created under your account, run the following command:

```ibmcloud pi spp list```

The following example output is displayed:

Listing shared processor pools under account Test Account as user `test_user@www.xxx.xx`:
| ID                                   | Available Cores | Host group | Host ID | Name         | Reserved Cores | Allocated Cores | Status | Status Detail      |

### Clean Up after DR Rehearsal at workgroup level
{: #cl-up-wg-le}

Once validation is complete, revert the rehearsal environment usingby running the following command:

```
ksysmgr cleanup wg -h
ksysmgr [-f] cleanup workgroup <name>
      dr_test=<yes>
      [force=<true|false>]
    cleanup => clean*
    workgroup => workg*, work_g*, wg
```
An output that is similar to the following example is displayed:
```
ksysmgr cleanup wg test1 dr_test=yes
04:46:33 Workgroup dr_test cleanup started for test1, this may take a few minutes...
04:46:44 dr_test cleanup has started for Workgroup test1

04:46:44 VM Volumes clone with consistency delete has completed for VM test2
04:46:44 VM Removal has started for VM test2
04:48:45 VM Removal has completed for VM test2
04:48:45 dr_test cleanup has completed for Workgroup test1
```

> **Note**: This command resets the test environment and returns the Workgroup to its pre-test state.

### Disaster Recovery (DR) rehearsal at site level
{: #drr-ree-mo-si-lee}

Disaster Recovery (DR) rehearsal at the Site level allows administrators to validate failover readiness across entire sites without impacting production workloads. The ksysmgr CLI supports DR rehearsal operations by enabling site movement and cleanup.

### View site information
{: #ve-si-info}

Run the following command to list the existing Sites and verify their details:

```ksysmgr q site```

An output similar to the following example is displayed:

```
