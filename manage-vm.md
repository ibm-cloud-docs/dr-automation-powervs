# Manage Virtual Servers

**Manage Virtual Servers** within the Disaster Recovery (DR) Automation for PowerVS enables administrators to monitor and control the virtual server instances that are part of the disaster recovery environment. Through this interface, users can manage existing virtual servers, check their current statuses, and perform actions such as adding or removing servers to maintain optimal DR operations. This tool ensures that all servers involved in the DR plan are properly orchestrated and functional, safeguarding business continuity in the event of failures.

To set up additional virtual server instances and manage them within the DR Automation framework, users can either add virtual servers directly or access the external orchestrator interface for advanced configurations.

## Add Virtual Servers

1. Navigate to the **Manage Virtual Servers** section.
2. Click on the **Add Virtual Server** button.
3. You will be redirected to the **VMRM DR PowerVS External Orchestrator Interface (UI)**.
4. In the external orchestrator interface, follow the guided steps to configure and add virtual servers to your disaster recovery setup.
5. After the servers are successfully added, they will appear in the list under **Managed Virtual Servers**.

Efficient management of virtual servers through the DR Automation interface, coupled with the external orchestrator, ensures that your disaster recovery environment remains scalable and resilient. This seamless process provides confidence that your critical systems will be protected in the face of potential failures, maintaining business continuity.
