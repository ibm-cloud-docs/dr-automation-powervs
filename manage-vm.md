# Managing virtual servers
{: #manage-vm-ser}

Manage Virtual Servers within the  {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}} enables administrators to monitor and control the virtual server instances running critical workloads. Through this interface, users can manage existing virtual servers, check their current status, and perform actions such as adding or removing Power virtual server instances to enable disaster recovery through orchestator. This tool ensures that all servers involved in the DR plan are properly orchestrated and functional, safeguarding business continuity in the event of failures.

To set up and manage additional virtual server instances,you can use either DR Automation management UI or access the external orchestrator interface to add and manage advanced configuration for enabling disaster recovery.
   > **Note**: Currently IBM Power Virtual Server Private Cloud officially supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), IBM i, and IBM AIXÂ® operating systems for creating virtual servers.
## Add virtual servers
{: #manage-vm-ser-added}

### Procedure
{: #manage-vm-ser-procedure}

1. Navigate to the **Manage Virtual Servers** table.
   > **Note**: DR Automation supports all virtual server instances as Managed Virtual Servers that are created through IBM Power Virtual Server. To learn more about all the supported Managed Virtual Server instances, click [IBM Power Virtual Server documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas){: external}.
2. Click **Add Virtual Server** button.
3. You are redirected to the external orchestrator interface (UI),The orchestrator UI is launched at
https://`<Orchestrator IP>`:3000/login.
   > **Note**: The `<Orchestrator IP>` is the system on which the orchestrator UI is installed and it is loaded automatically.
4. In the external orchestrator interface, follow the guided steps to configure and add **virtual servers** to your disaster recovery setup.
5. After the servers are successfully added, the servers are displayed in the list under **Managed Virtual Servers**.

Efficient management of virtual servers through the {{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} interface, coupled with the external orchestrator, ensures that your disaster recovery environment remains scalable and resilient. This seamless process provides confidence that your critical systems will be protected in the face of potential failures, maintaining business continuity.

### Managed power virtual servers
{: #vm-details}

Displays the list of virtual machines configured for disaster recovery with details like VM name, VM ID, memory, Core and Workgroup name, which you can sort based on your requirement by using the sort option.

Following are the configured VM details:

**VM name**:
Name of the virtual machine added for DR management.  

**VM ID**:
Unique identifier assigned to the virtual machine.  

**Memory**:
Amount of memory allocated to the virtual machine.  

**Core**:
Number of processor cores assigned to the virtual machine.  

**Workgroup name**:
Workgroup to which the virtual machine belongs for DR operations.  

For more information about **External Orchestrator Interface (UI)**, see [IBM VM Recovery Manager DR for Power Systems](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/vmrmdr).
