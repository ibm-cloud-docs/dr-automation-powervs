### Step 1: Accessing the cost estimator
{: #accst}

- Use your IBM credentials to access the **IBM Cloud catalog**.

- In the **search box**, type IBM {{site.data.keyword.DR_full}}.

- **Click** {{site.data.keyword.DR_full_notm}} tile.


### Step 2: Creating an estimate for resources
{: #createst}

You can generate an estimate by specifying the necessary **configurations** for DR resources, such as the number of **cores**. This process allows you to review projected costs before making deployment decisions.

> **Note**: Creating an estimate incurs no charges, resources are billed only upon deployment.

- Choose the **{{site.data.keyword.DR_short}}** setup as it is hosted within IBMâ€™s data centers.

- Choose the **IBM Cloud region** where the DR resources will be hosted.

- Define the number of cores required for DR.

- Enable **Orchestrator HA** option if high availability is needed for your orchestrator. Additional charges may apply.


### Step 3: Adding to estimate and viewing summary
{: #stps}

- Click **Add** to estimate to **save** your configured DR resources.
- Review the Total Estimated Cost on the right panel, which includes core-based charges for DR software licenses.


### Step 4: Saving and viewing the estimate
{: #stepss}

- After configuring, **save** the estimate with a **unique name** and optional description.
- Access your saved estimate to review the detailed cost breakdown.


### Step 5: Exporting the estimate
{: #ete}

- Export the saved estimate as an **XLSX**, **CSV**, or **PDF** file.

- This allows for offline review and sharing with stakeholders.
