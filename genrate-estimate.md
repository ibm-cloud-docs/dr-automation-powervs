# Generating an Estimate for DR Automation on IBM Power Virtual Server

Use the cost estimator tool to evaluate potential costs for DR Automation resources before deployment. This tool allows customization of configurations to align with your disaster recovery needs.

## Use the Cost Estimator Tool For

- Creating an estimate for DR automation resources
- Saving and reviewing your estimate
- Exporting estimates for record-keeping

---

## Steps to Generate an Estimate for DR Automation

### Step 1: Accessing the Cost Estimator

1. **Log in to IBM Cloud Catalog**  
   - Use your IBM credentials to access the IBM Cloud catalog.

2. **Select DR Automation for Power Virtual Server**  
   - In the search box, type **DR Automation for Power Virtual Server**.
   - Click on the **DR Automation for Power Virtual Server** tile.

---

### Step 2: Creating an Estimate for Resources

You can generate an estimate by specifying the necessary configurations for DR resources, such as the number of cores. This process allows you to review projected costs before making deployment decisions.

> **Note**: Creating an estimate incurs no charges. Resources are billed only upon deployment.

1. **Select the Location Type**  
   - Choose the **DR Automation setup** as it is hosted within IBMâ€™s data centers.

2. **Configure DR-Specific Parameters**  
   - **Disaster Recovery Location**: Choose the IBM Cloud region where the DR resources will be hosted.
   - **Total Managed Cores**: Define the number of cores required for DR.
   - **Orchestrator HA**: Enable this option if high availability is needed for your orchestrator. Additional charges may apply.

---

### Step 3: Adding to Estimate and Viewing Summary

- **Add to Estimate**: Click **Add to estimate** to save your configured DR resources.
- Review the **Total Estimated Cost** on the right panel, which includes core-based charges for DR software licenses.

---

### Step 4: Saving and Viewing the Estimate

1. After configuring, save the estimate with a unique name and optional description.
2. **View Estimate**: Access your saved estimate to review the detailed cost breakdown.

---

### Step 5: Exporting the Estimate

1. **Download**: Export the saved estimate as an **XLSX**, **CSV**, or **PDF** file.
2. This allows for offline review and sharing with stakeholders.
