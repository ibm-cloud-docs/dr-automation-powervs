## High-Level Architecture

The **DR Automation for PowerVS** system operates within IBM data centers, isolated from the core IBM Cloud environment. Utilizing dedicated networks and direct-attached storage ensures secure, high-performance disaster recovery (DR) capabilities tailored for fast, reliable workload recovery.

Central to this architecture is the **Service Broker**, which manages compute, storage, and network resources to streamline and automate DR processes. It simplifies recovery setup, enabling customers to quickly deploy and manage DR services through an intuitive interface.

The **Orchestrator (KSYS)** is crucial in coordinating DR workflows, ensuring Virtual Machines (VMs) are brought online in the correct order during recovery. This automation minimizes downtime and data loss, helping organizations confidently meet their **Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)**.

This setup provides a secure, seamless DR solution that integrates with your production environment, enabling smooth failover and failback to maintain business continuity in case of unexpected events.

## Key Features

### Simplified Disaster Recovery Management

DR Automation for PowerVS provides a single interface to manage DR processes for IBM PowerVS environments. Key features include:

- **Automated Failover and Failback**:
Automate the failover process, ensuring that workloads resume quickly in the backup environment.

- **Scheduling and Monitoring**:
Schedule DR operations and monitor the health and status of DR sites.

- **Customizable Recovery Settings**:
Define recovery priorities and configurations for different VMs or applications.

### IBM Cloud Service Framework Integration

The **IBM Cloud Service Framework** provides a streamlined experience for disaster recovery (DR) automation. At the heart of this framework, the **Service Broker** manages resources for compute, storage, and network, enabling users to select DR services from the **IBM Cloud Catalog** and specify deployment parameters with ease. The **Resource Management Controller (RMC)** automates provisioning tasks and configures VMs for DR, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Additional IBM Cloud services, such as Activity Tracker, IBM LogDNA, Cloud Object Storage (COS), and Key Management, support the DR solution by enhancing security, auditability, and compliance. These services are interconnected through secure, redundant network paths, providing a reliable and resilient environment for business continuity.

### Flexible Billing Model

DR Automation for PowerVS follows a usage-based billing model, with flexible options based on the selected resources and configurations. The IBM Cloud Service Framework supports accurate billing and comprehensive reporting, ensuring customers have clear visibility into DR-related costs.

## IBM Cloud Service Framework


The **IBM Cloud Service Framework** enhances DR Automation for PowerVS by enabling seamless service deployment and management. Key components include:

- **Service Broker**: Manages compute, storage, and network resources, allowing users to select DR services from the IBM Cloud Catalog and configure deployment details. This component plays a central role in streamlining and automating DR processes.

- **Resource Management Controller (RMC)**: Automates provisioning, image import, and VM configuration, making DR deployment efficient and straightforward for users.

- **Orchestrator (KSYS)**: Coordinates DR workflows and ensures that VMs recover in a defined sequence, minimizing downtime and data loss.

- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures a secure, compliant environment through robust controls and monitoring. This includes IBM Cloud services like Activity Tracker (for monitoring) Cloud Object Storage (COS) (for secure storage), and Key Management (for data security).

- **Reliable Connectivity**: Maintains continuous, secure access to DR resources through redundant network connections, enhancing reliability and resilience.

This integrated framework provides a secure, compliant, and efficient DR solution that aligns closely with the high-level architecture for DR Automation in IBM data centers.
