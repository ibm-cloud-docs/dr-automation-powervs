# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/) seeks to create a harmonized data protection law framework across the European Union (EU) and aims to give citizens back the control of their personal data. The GDPR imposes strict rules on those hosting and processing personal data anywhere in the world. Additionally, this regulation introduces rules that relate to the free movement of personal data within and outside of the EU.

With the GDPR,IBM {{site.data.keyword.DR_full_notm}} clients can rely on the {{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} team's understanding and compliance with emerging data privacy standards and legislation. Power Virtual Server clients can also rely on IBM's wider ability to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions to assist businesses of all sizes with their own internal data governance requirements.

## Online retention of client data

Client data is retained during the active subscription to {{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} (that is, until the client's contract termination or expiration). By default, this ensures uninterrupted data access and functionality throughout the subscription period. Clients can optionally configure shorter retention periods for specific data types within the service, aligning with their organizational retention policies. All client data is securely removed from the {{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} environment one business day after the termination or expiration of the client's contract.

## Backup retention of client data  

{{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} does not provide backups of client data. Clients are responsible for implementing their own backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Destruction of client data  

{{site.data.keyword.DR_short}} allows clients to delete all online client data upon their request or upon the termination of the service contract. Secure destruction of all client data is performed at the end of the life cycle of the associated infrastructure or cloud service, ensuring compliance with industry standards.

## Export of client data  

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
IBM contractually commits to providing clients with the capability to export their data as required by industry and government regulations. For {{site.data.keyword.DR_short}}, clients can export their data independently or request IBM to provide export copies of their data.
