# Managing VM sessions in GUI

Efficiently set up and manage VM sessions by creating new sessions, organizing virtual machines into WorkGroups, and saving configurations for streamlined virtual machine management.

After creating the sites, you must create a new VM session if you are managing the virtual machine for the first time. If the virtual machine has already been managed, you can proceed directly to manage the VM sessions.

To create and manage virtual machines, complete the following steps:

1. Click **Create New Session**.

2. To create WorkGroups, search for or select the virtual machines based on your requirements.

3. Display only the selected virtual machines for the session.

4. To create the Target Workspace, search for or select the virtual machines according to your requirements, and click **Save & Next**.

> **Note**: The WorkGroup name is auto-generated based on the VM name. You can modify it if necessary.
