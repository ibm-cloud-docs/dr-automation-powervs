# Managing external orchestrator
{: #manage-exter}

When you add virtual servers, you are redirected to the external orchestrator interface ({{site.data.keyword.DR_full}}). This interface guides you through the necessary steps to configure and include virtual servers in your disaster recovery setup.

## Steps to access the external orchestrator
{: #access-ext-orch}

1. Enter your login credentials and click **Log In**. Use the credentials configured on your system.

2. To **Save** login credentials, check the **Remember Me** option that enables the system to remember your login credentials for up to 24 hours.


 >**Note:** The credentials are remembered for 10 hours, if **Remember Me** option is unchecked.


3. After successfully logging into the {{site.data.keyword.DR_full_notm}} GUI, you are redirected to the [KSYS cluster creation](https://10.32.150.93:3000/login?byCloud=true) screen where you can add the KSYS cluster.
