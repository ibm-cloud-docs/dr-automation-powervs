# Managing external orchestrator

When adding virtual servers, you are redirected to the external orchestrator interface (VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI). This interface guides you through the necessary steps to configure and include virtual servers in your disaster recovery setup.

## Steps to access the external orchestrator

1. Enter your login credentials and click **Log In**. Use the credentials configured on your system.

2. To Save Login credentials, check **Remember Me** option that enable the system to remember your login credentials for up to 24 hours.

- Note: The credentials will be remembered for 10 hours, if **Remember Me** option is unchecked.

After successfully logging into the VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI, you are redirected to the [KSYS (Orchestrator) cluster creation]() screen where you will be adding the KSYS cluster.
