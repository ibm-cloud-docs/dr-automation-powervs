# Managing External Orchestrator

When adding virtual servers, you are redirected to the external orchestrator interface (VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI). This interface guides you through the necessary steps to configure and include virtual servers in your disaster recovery setup.

## Steps to Access the External Orchestrator

1. **Enter Login Credentials**:  
   On the login page, provide your username and password, and then click **Log In**. Use the credentials configured on your system.

2. **Optional: Save Login Details**:  
   - To enable the system to remember your login details for up to 24 hours, select the **Remember Me** option.  
   - If this option is not selected, the credentials will be remembered for 10 hours.

After successfully logging into the VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI, you are redirected to the [KSYS (Orchestrator) cluster creation]() screen.
