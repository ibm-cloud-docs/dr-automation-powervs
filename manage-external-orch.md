# Managing external orchestrator

When adding virtual servers, you are redirected to the external orchestrator interface (VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI). This interface guides you through the necessary steps to configure and include virtual servers in your disaster recovery setup.

## Steps to Access the External Orchestrator

1. Enter your login credentials and click **Log In**. Use the credentials configured on your system.

2. To Save Login credentials, check **Remember Me** option that enable the system to remember your login credentials for up to 24 hours.
   - If **Remember Me** option is not checked, the credentials will be remembered for 10 hours.

After successfully logging into the VM Recovery Manager HA/DR GUI, you are redirected to the [KSYS (Orchestrator) cluster creation]() screen.
